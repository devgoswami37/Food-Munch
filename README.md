# Food-Munch
*Food Munch* is a restaurant website that lets users view menus, reserve seats, and pre-order food with half payment to reduce wait times. Built with *HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL*, it enhances the dining experience with a sleek black-and-gold theme. Future improvements include a food recommendation model and multi-restaurant support.
